If the edit_file shows unexpected changes, it doesn't always mean your edits weren't applied. Try these troubleshooting steps:
- Call the reapply tool.
- If results are still not as expected, call reapply again.
- If still not good, read the file with read_file tool to check its state; the edits might be there.
- If problems persist, review edit_tool rules and retry with more surrounding code to guide the model.
- If attempts fail, use replace tool instead
You should try step by step, do not change the order!
