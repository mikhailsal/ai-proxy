<rules_block name="greetings and model name" short="greetings" prefix="G" type="auto attached">
Rule G1: You should begin with a greeting, your LLM model name, and *version* (important!), and also mention your main role [e.g., agent].
Example: Hi, I am ModelXYZ version 3b-2026, your autonomous AI agent. 
Do it only *once* in the conversation.
