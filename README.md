# AI Proxy Service

This service acts as a drop-in replacement for the OpenAI API, providing a unified interface to route requests to various Large Language Model (LLM) providers like OpenRouter.

It is built with Python and FastAPI and is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy with **HTTPS support** and automatic SSL certificate management.

## Features (Phase 1)

*   **OpenAI API Compatibility**: `POST /v1/chat/completions` endpoint.
*   **Provider Routing**: Currently supports proxying requests to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).
*   **Model Mapping**: Configure model aliases or use wildcards to map friendly names to specific provider models (e.g., `gpt-4` -> `openai/gpt-4`).
*   **Authentication**: Secure the proxy with API keys.
*   **HTTPS Support**: Automatic SSL certificate management with Let's Encrypt via Traefik.
*   **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs for easy parsing and monitoring.
*   **Containerized**: Ready to deploy with Docker and Docker Compose.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+
*   [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.
*   Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment).
*   A domain name (for HTTPS in production).

### Quick HTTPS Setup (Recommended)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd ai-proxy
    ```

2.  **Run the HTTPS setup script:**
    ```bash
    ./scripts/setup-https.sh
    ```

3.  **Configure your domain:**
    Edit the `.env` file with your domain and credentials:
    ```bash
    # Required for HTTPS
    DOMAIN=your-domain.com
    ACME_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
    
    # Your API configuration
    API_KEYS=your-secret-key-1,your-secret-key-2
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key
    ```

4.  **Deploy with HTTPS:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

5.  **Test the setup:**
    ```bash
    ./scripts/test-https.sh
    ```

Your service will be available at:
- **AI Proxy**: `https://your-domain.com`
- **Traefik Dashboard**: `https://traefik.your-domain.com`

### Domain Options

#### üÜì Free Temporary Domains (for testing)
- **nip.io**: Set `DOMAIN=myapp.YOUR-SERVER-IP.nip.io`
- **sslip.io**: Set `DOMAIN=myapp.YOUR-SERVER-IP.sslip.io`
- Replace `YOUR-SERVER-IP` with your server's public IP address

#### üåç Real Domain (recommended for production)
- Buy a domain from any registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
- Point A record to your server's IP
- Set `DOMAIN=your-domain.com`

#### üß™ Development with ngrok
- Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
- Run: `ngrok http 80`
- Use the ngrok domain in your `DOMAIN` variable

### Local Development (HTTP)

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your configuration
    ```

3.  **Run the service:**
    ```bash
    poetry run uvicorn ai_proxy.main:app --reload
    ```
    The service will be available at `http://localhost:8123`.

### Docker Deployment (HTTP only)

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t ai-proxy .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d --env-file .env -p 8123:8123 --name ai-proxy-container ai-proxy
    ```

## Usage

Make requests to the proxy service just as you would with the OpenAI API:

### HTTPS (Production)
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-key-1" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is the capital of France?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### HTTP (Development)
```bash
curl http://localhost:8123/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-key-1" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is the capital of France?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

The `model` field will be automatically mapped according to your `config.yml`. For example, if you have `"gpt-4": "openai/gpt-4"` in your config, the request will be sent to OpenRouter with the model `openai/gpt-4`.

## HTTPS Configuration

The service uses **Traefik** as a reverse proxy with automatic **Let's Encrypt** SSL certificate management. This provides:

- ‚úÖ Automatic SSL certificate generation and renewal
- ‚úÖ HTTP to HTTPS redirect
- ‚úÖ Security headers (HSTS, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Load balancing capabilities
- ‚úÖ Monitoring dashboard

### Troubleshooting HTTPS

If HTTPS is not working:

1. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs traefik
   docker-compose logs ai-proxy
   ```

2. **Verify domain accessibility:**
   ```bash
   curl -I http://your-domain.com
   ```

3. **Test certificate generation:**
   - Let's Encrypt requires your domain to be publicly accessible
   - Check DNS propagation: `nslookup your-domain.com`
   - Verify ports 80 and 443 are open

4. **Run the test script:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-https.sh
   ```
